# Kbot
Discord bot using DiscordJS & NodeJS. This is not meant to be an eleborate bot but just some utility functions and cool things for my friends and to learn some NodeJS and modern Development and Deployment

# Set Up
- git clone repository
- npm install
- setup heroku project with two (2) env variables PREFIX (ex ! or ?) which distinguishes commands for Kbot and TOKEN which is your bots api token.
- local environment uses dotenv and a .env file

# Running
node . or heroku local if you are using the heroku cli tool. Should work with tools like nodemon.

# Major TODO:
- clean up code / refactor
- Tests, I need to learn to unit test
